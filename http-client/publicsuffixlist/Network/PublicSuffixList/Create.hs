This script parses the public suffix list, and constructs a data structure which can
be used with the isSuffix function in Lookup.hs. It exports a GSink which produces
the opaque 'DataStructure' and can be fed any Source as input.

This makes an few assumption about the information in the public suffix list:
namely, that no rule is a suffix of another rule. For example, if there is a rule
abc.def.ghi
then there is no other rule
def.ghi
or
!def.ghi

The actual data structure involved here is a tree where the nodes have no value and
the edges are DNS labels. There are two trees: one to handle the exception rules,
and one to handle the regular rules.
